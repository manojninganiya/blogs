# C# Programming
We are working on various aspects of C# including object-oriented principles, data types, collections, exception handling, async programming, and more.

üÜö .NET Core vs .NET Framework Comparison

| **Aspect**                       | **.NET Core / .NET (5+)**                                                | **.NET Framework**                              |

| **Microservices**                | ‚úÖ Excellent ‚Äì lightweight, container-friendly                            | ‚ùå Not suitable ‚Äì heavy, monolithic              |
| **Cloud Support**                | ‚úÖ First-class Azure support, ideal for containers & serverless           | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited, older integration                   |
| **CLI Tools**                    | ‚úÖ Modern unified CLI (`dotnet`)                                          | ‚ùå Legacy MSBuild/Visual Studio-only             |
| **Side-by-side Versioning**      | ‚úÖ Supported ‚Äì apps can run different versions on the same machine        | ‚ùå Global install affects all apps               |
| **Package Management**           | ‚úÖ NuGet + better dependency resolution                                   | ‚úÖ NuGet                                         |
| **Third-party Support**          | ‚úÖ Growing and modern (e.g., gRPC, Minimal APIs)                          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Mature but stagnating                        |
| **Long-term Viability**          | ‚úÖ Active development (.NET 8+ and beyond)                                | ‚ùå Maintenance mode (only .NET Framework 4.8+)   |
| **Performance for Static Sites** | ‚úÖ Lightweight and fast for generating static sites pre-deployment        | ‚ùå Not suitable ‚Äì too heavy for static workflows |
| **Deployment Style**             | ‚úÖ Self-contained, cross-platform publishing                              | ‚ùå Requires Windows IIS hosting                  |

üÜö Difference Between `String` and `StringBuilder`

| Feature                 | `String`                                           | `StringBuilder`                                    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Namespace**           | `System`                                           | `System.Text`                                      |
| **Mutability**          | Immutable ‚Äì every modification creates a new string | Mutable ‚Äì changes the same object in memory        |
| **Performance (Concat)**| Slower for repeated modifications (e.g., in loops) | Faster for multiple string operations              |
| **Memory Usage**        | Higher (due to new string instances)               | Lower (reuses same memory buffer)                  |
| **Thread Safety**       | Thread-safe (immutable by nature)                  | Not thread-safe by default                         |
| **Use Case**            | Best for a small number of changes                 | Best for frequent or large string manipulations    |
| **Common Methods**      | `Replace()`, `Substring()`, `ToUpper()`            | `Append()`, `Insert()`, `Replace()`, `Remove()`    |
| **Declaration Example** | `string s = "Hello";`                              | `StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");`   |
