# C# Programming
We are working on various aspects of C# including object-oriented principles, data types, collections, exception handling, async programming, and more.
## ðŸ†š Difference Between `String` and `StringBuilder`

| Feature                 | `String`                                           | `StringBuilder`                                    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Namespace**           | `System`                                           | `System.Text`                                      |
| **Mutability**          | Immutable â€“ every modification creates a new string | Mutable â€“ changes the same object in memory        |
| **Performance (Concat)**| Slower for repeated modifications (e.g., in loops) | Faster for multiple string operations              |
| **Memory Usage**        | Higher (due to new string instances)               | Lower (reuses same memory buffer)                  |
| **Thread Safety**       | Thread-safe (immutable by nature)                  | Not thread-safe by default                         |
| **Use Case**            | Best for a small number of changes                 | Best for frequent or large string manipulations    |
| **Common Methods**      | `Replace()`, `Substring()`, `ToUpper()`            | `Append()`, `Insert()`, `Replace()`, `Remove()`    |
| **Declaration Example** | `string s = "Hello";`                              | `StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");`   |

### ðŸ”¤ Code Example: `String`
```csharp
string message = "Hello";
message += " World"; // Creates a new string in memory
Console.WriteLine(message); // Output: Hello World
