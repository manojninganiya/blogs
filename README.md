# C# Programming

## 4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#
Here's a quick mnemonic to remember the 4 main OOP concepts in C# in order:

**_A PIE_** (Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation)

---

### 1. **Abstraction**
- Hides complex implementation details
- Shows only the **essential features**
- Achieved through:
  - **Abstract classes**
  - **Interfaces**

---

### 2. **Polymorphism**
- "Many forms" ‚Äì same method behaves differently
- Types:
  - **Method Overloading** (Compile-time polymorphism)
  - **Method Overriding** (Runtime polymorphism)

---

### 3. **Inheritance**
- Defines a **base class ‚Üí derived class** relationship
- Promotes **code reusability**
- Based on **"is-a"** relationship

---

### 4. **Encapsulation**
- Bundles **data** and **methods** that operate on it
- Controls access using:
  - `private`, `protected`, `public` modifiers
  - **Properties** (`get`/`set`) for controlled access

---


### What's the difference between `null` and a `NullReferenceException` ?
Many people think they‚Äôre the same ‚Äî but they‚Äôre not.

`null`: A **valid value** in C# that means **"no object reference."**  
It‚Äôs often used to indicate the absence of a value or an uninitialized object.

`NullReferenceException`: A runtime exception that occurs when you try to access a member (property, method, etc.) on a null reference.

```
string s = null;        // null means "s" doesn't refer to any object
Console.WriteLine(s.Length); // ‚ùå Throws NullReferenceException
```

Here, `s` is `null`, so trying to access `s.Length` triggers a `NullReferenceException`.

---
### Why does `string.Replace()` not modify the original string?

Many developers expect it to behave like array or list operations, which modify data in-place. But strings in C# don‚Äôt work that way.

**Strings are immutable** in C# ‚Äî meaning once a string is created, its value **cannot be changed**.

Methods like `.Replace()`, `.ToUpper()`, `.Trim()`, etc., always return a **new string** and leave the original string unchanged.

```
string s1 = "Hello";
string s2 = s1.Replace("H", "J"); // Creates a new string "Jello"

Console.WriteLine(s1); // Output: Hello (original unchanged)
Console.WriteLine(s2); // Output: Jello (new string)
```
---
### Why is this code inefficient?

```
int num = 10;
object boxed = num;            // Boxing (heap allocation)
int unboxed = (int)boxed;      // Unboxing (type check + copy)
```
Boxing converts a value type to object (heap allocation).

Unboxing converts back (type check + copy).

Performance impact: Extra memory and CPU overhead.

---
### Does `await` make the calling thread wait?

Many developers think `await` blocks the thread, like synchronous code ‚Äî but that's a misunderstanding.

**No, `await` does not block the calling thread.**

When an `await` is encountered, the current method:
- **Yields control** back to the calling context
- **Releases the thread** to do other work
- **Resumes** the continuation when the awaited task completes

```
async Task DoWorkAsync()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000); // Thread is released during this delay
    Console.WriteLine("Done"); // Resumes here after delay
}
```
---
### Why do we need `events` when we already have `delegates` in C#?

Developers often think delegates and events are interchangeable. But events offer an **encapsulation benefit** that delegates alone lack.

- A **delegate** is a type that represents a reference to a method.
- An **event** wraps a delegate to provide **encapsulation and restricted access**.

### üîê Key Difference:

| Feature          | Delegate                          | Event                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Invocation       | Anyone with access can invoke it  | Only the **declaring class** can invoke it |
| Subscription     | Public can subscribe/unsubscribe  | Public can subscribe/unsubscribe            |
| Use case         | General method references         | Encapsulated, safe **notifications**        |

### Example:

```
using System;

public delegate void Notify();

public class Publisher
{
    // ‚ùå Public delegate (not safe)
    public Notify myDelegate;

    // ‚úÖ Public event (safe)
    public event Notify OnCompleted;

    public void DoWork()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Doing work...");

        // Invoke delegate directly (unsafe, can be misused externally)
        myDelegate?.Invoke();

        // Invoke event (only allowed here ‚Äî not from outside this class)
        OnCompleted?.Invoke();
    }
}

public class Subscriber
{
    public void Handler()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Work completed!");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
        Subscriber subscriber = new Subscriber();

        // ‚ùó External access ‚Äî delegate can be overwritten!
        publisher.myDelegate = subscriber.Handler; // Also allows removal or replacement

        // ‚úÖ Event ‚Äî allows only += / -= (subscription), not reassignment or invocation
        publisher.OnCompleted += subscriber.Handler;

        publisher.DoWork();

        // ‚ùå The following is legal for delegate:
        publisher.myDelegate(); // Unsafe ‚Äî external code can invoke it

        // ‚ùå The following is illegal for event:
        // publisher.OnCompleted(); // ‚ùå Compile-time error: cannot invoke event from outside
    }
}
```

### Will this object be garbage collected?

```csharp
class Test {
    static void Main() {
        var obj = new LargeObject();
        obj = null;

        GC.Collect(); // Suggests GC run
        // Is obj collected here?
    }
}
```

Setting `obj = null` makes the object **eligible for garbage collection**, but **it is not guaranteed** to be collected immediately.

The .NET **Garbage Collector (GC)** is **non-deterministic**:
- It decides **when** to collect memory based on internal heuristics.
- Calling `GC.Collect()` only **suggests** a collection ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt force immediate cleanup.


### To ensure finalizers run:

If the object has a **finalizer (`~LargeObject()`)**, you can explicitly wait for it:

```csharp
GC.Collect();
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
```

- `GC.Collect()` suggests collection.
- `GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers()` blocks until all finalizers are complete.

### Deterministic Cleanup (Best Practice):

Instead of relying on GC, use `IDisposable` with a `using` block for deterministic resource cleanup:

```csharp
using (var obj = new LargeObject())
{
    // Use the object safely
} // obj.Dispose() is automatically called here
```

This approach:
- Ensures timely cleanup of resources (e.g., file handles, DB connections)
- Avoids reliance on garbage collection timing

### Summary Table:

| Action                             | Behavior                                     |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `obj = null`                       | Marks object as collectible                  |
| `GC.Collect()`                     | Suggests GC run (not guaranteed)             |
| `GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers()`    | Waits for any finalizers to complete         |
| `using / IDisposable`              | Provides immediate, predictable cleanup      |

###  Tip:
Avoid relying on `GC.Collect()` in production code.  
Use `IDisposable` and `using` blocks for managing **unmanaged resources** like files, streams, or database connections.
